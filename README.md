# [Quarentainment!](https://jaredhennessy.github.io/Quarentainment/)

## Project Description

We will provide a list of movies, TV shows, and books, based on popularity, critics picks, and/ or user-selected genre, to the user. The user can then save their picks as a to-do list that they can check off as they go.

## User Story

AS a bored content consumer during a pandemic, I would like to visit a site and see entertainment options that match my interests. I would like to be able to keep a running list of items that interest me to refer back to at a later date.

## APIs to be Used:

1. The Movie Database

## Rough Breakdown of Tasks

1. Evaluate APIs for suitability and ease of use by creating a small demo:
   1. Results from the entertainment APIs given a hardcoded search parameter
   1. An event posted to a google calendar requiring the user to log into their google account
1. Finalize list of APIs and user prompts
1. Decide on a CSS framework
1. Create page elements based on our wireframe and list of user prompts
1. Build API calls using user prompts
1. Write javascript to update page with API responses
1. Create localstorage-based functionality to save and display user picks
1. Finalize page styling
